/// The largest secret that may be split.

/// Shamir shares are byte-wise: an S-byte secret becomes `n` shares of S bytes each, every one of
/// them encrypted, base64-encoded into its own request, and held by the relay until its holder
/// picks it up — while the sender retains a copy of all `n` until every pickup is confirmed. The
/// cost of a secret is therefore several times its size, several times over, which is why there is
/// a limit at all and why it is this modest.
///
/// It applies to every secret uniformly, typed text included, and is enforced in the domain rather
/// than at an input form so that no entry point can slip past it — a re-split during a repair least
/// of all.
///
/// The relay enforces a bound of its own, deliberately looser: it cannot know what any client's
/// limit is.
